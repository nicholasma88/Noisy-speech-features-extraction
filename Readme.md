This paper proposes a new way to dynamically determine the
warping scale factor, alpha, for Vocal Tract Length Normalization
(VTLN) and explores lesser known noise reduction algorithms to
improve an isolated-word recognizer. It addresses speech feature
extraction improvements in two areas: gender mismatch and noisy
environments. For gender mismatch, we propose dynamically
determining the scale factor based on the probability distribution of
female pitch. For noise robustness, this paper will present a
Single-Channel Noise Reduction (SCNR) algorithm based on a
Magnitude-DFT (MDFT) estimator in conjunction with a
complex-DFT estimator (CDFT) to reduce the effect of noise on
feature extraction for speech.
